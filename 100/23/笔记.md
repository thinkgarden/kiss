### CSS3 :first-of-type Selector

Specify a background color for the first <p> element of its parent:

    p:first-of-type {
        background: #ff0000;
    }


** Definition and Usage **

The :first-of-type selector matches every element that is the first child, of a particular type, of its parent.

** Tip: ** This is the same as :nth-of-type(1).
